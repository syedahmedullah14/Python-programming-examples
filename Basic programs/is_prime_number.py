# Q. Python program to check whether a number is Prime or not
'''
Given a positive integer N. The task is to write a Python program to check if the number is prime or not.

Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

Examples :

Input:  n = 11
Output: true

Input:  n = 15
Output: false

Input:  n = 1
Output: false
'''

num = 11
  
# If given number is greater than 1 
if num > 1: 
      
   # Iterate from 2 to n / 2  
   for i in range(2, num): 
         
       # If num is divisible by any number between  
       # 2 and n / 2, it is not prime  
       if (num % i) == 0: 
           print(num, "is not a prime number") 
           break
   else: 
       print(num, "is a prime number") 
  
else: 
   print(num, "is not a prime number")
